I see the leaf in the picture is affected by a fungal or bacterial disease â€“ the brown spots with yellowish edges are common symptoms of leaf spot disease (often caused by fungi like Alternaria, Cercospora, or Colletotrichum).
Here are some simple solutions you can try:

### ðŸŒ± Natural/Home Remedies:
- **Neem Spray:** Mix neem oil ($5$ ml) in $1$ liter of water with a few drops of soap. Spray on both sides of the leaves every $7$ days.
- **Baking Soda Spray:** Mix $1$ teaspoon baking soda + $1$ liter water + few drops of liquid soap. Spray on infected leaves to reduce fungal growth.
- **Garlic Extract:** Crush garlic, mix with water, filter, and spray on the plants. It acts as a natural antifungal.

### ðŸŒ¿ Good Gardening Practices:
- Remove and destroy infected leaves (donâ€™t compost them).
- Water at the base of the plant, not on the leaves.
- Give plants good spacing for airflow.
- Rotate crops (donâ€™t grow the same plant in the same soil every season).

### ðŸ’Š If Natural Methods Fail (Chemical Option):
- Use a fungicide like Mancozeb, Chlorothalonil, or Copper oxychloride (follow instructions on the pack).

I see the leaf has a powdery white or grayish coating on its surface, which is a classic symptom of Powdery Mildew, a common fungal disease.
Here are some simple solutions you can try:

### ðŸŒ± Natural/Home Remedies:
- **Milk Spray:** Mix milk with water in a 1:1 ratio. The milk proteins have antifungal properties that can fight the mildew.
- **Baking Soda Spray:** Mix 1 teaspoon baking soda + 1 liter water + few drops of liquid soap. This is effective for reducing fungal growth.
- **Pruning:** Prune away and dispose of the most heavily affected leaves and stems to prevent the disease from spreading.

### ðŸŒ¿ Good Gardening Practices:
- Improve air circulation by spacing plants appropriately.
- Water at the base of the plant to keep leaves dry.
- Avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen, which promotes soft new growth that is susceptible to mildew.

### ðŸ’Š If Natural Methods Fail (Chemical Option):
- Use a fungicide containing sulfur or potassium bicarbonate (follow instructions on the pack).

The leaf in the picture shows small, rusty-brown spots or pustules, which are characteristic signs of Leaf Rust. This is a fungal disease that can reduce a plantâ€™s ability to photosynthesize.

### ðŸŒ± Natural/Home Remedies:
- **Neem Spray:** Mix neem oil ($5$ ml) in $1$ liter of water with a few drops of soap. Spray on both sides of the leaves every $7$ days.
- **Horticultural Oil:** Apply horticultural oil to the leaves. It can smother fungal spores and prevent them from spreading.
- **Copper Fungicide:** Natural copper fungicides are available and can be effective.

### ðŸŒ¿ Good Gardening Practices:
- Remove and destroy infected leaves (donâ€™t compost them).
- Water in the morning to allow leaves to dry out during the day.
- Ensure good air circulation around the plants.

### ðŸ’Š If Natural Methods Fail (Chemical Option):
- Use a systemic fungicide containing chlorothalonil or myclobutanil (follow instructions on the pack).
